## ðŸ“Š Data Source  
This project uses the **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data**, publicly available here:  
[NYC TLC Trip Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)  

Due to file size constraints, only a **sample dataset** (`data/sample_uber_data.csv`) is included in this repository. For full analysis, download the trip data directly from the TLC website.
